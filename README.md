You can test the test case in this way

``` ruby

ruby tc_stat.rb /repospath

```

and calculat the repos and src path in this way

``` ruby
ruby stat.rb /repopath /pathinrepo
```

the result will be 

```
java            [327285, 2268] #loc, files
jsp             [84971, 572]
xml             [5189, 93]
```

It's really easy.
